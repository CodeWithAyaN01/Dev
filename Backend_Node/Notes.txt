A warm breeze drifted through the quiet street as the last traces of sunlight slipped behind the old buildings. Shops were closing one by one, their shutters rattling softly in the calm evening air.

Far away, the sound of a train echoed faintly, reminding everyone that even in the stillness, the world kept moving.
